So we got our stream of tokens

Then the Lens part of the lib will be in filtering this stream...

No storage of gleaned parts is needed, just a contextualised cursor; its the prospect of a proper set of data - that'swhat we're providing

------

Question then over whether we wanna prioritise the filterin' or the emboyin'

the filterin requires a cursor, and presumably with a context

if we have a cursor, then we should have some way of peeking into its data

can we afford such an expense? doubtful... 

i mean, in the scheme of things its miniscule, but it kills the spirit of things, dunnit?

the same goes though for the stream of tokens - we don't want these to be actually output, surely (well, actually we do... they will always be emitted into a buffer)

so if we have a buffer for tokens, could we have a buffer for contexts? perhaps

------------------


The filter canbe used in reading very obviously
